Those numbers tend to be steady\nregardless of the length of the show &#8212; and according to Panoply,\nthe few listeners who do skip ads continue to remain engaged with\nthe episode, rather than dropping off at the first sign of an\ninterruption. “I think people are overall very relieved to see\nthat people are actually listening the way that we hoped,” says\nHeadgum CTO Andrew Pile. “There are really audiences out there who\nlisten to every word that comes out of [a host’s] mouth.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/marcoarment/status/958442990384623616\">Marco Arment</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The podcast business didn’t really need precise listener\nbehavioral data.

Well, here’s what\nmy new life is like: I don’t wake up with a pit in my stomach\nevery day, dreading what horrors accrued in my phone overnight. I\ndon’t get dragged into protracted, bad-faith arguments with\nteenage boys about whether poor people deserve medical care, or\nwhether putting nice guys in the friend zone is a hate crime. I\ndon’t spend hours every week blocking and reporting trolls and\nscreen-grabbing abuse in case it someday escalates into a credible\nthreat. I no longer feel like my brain is trapped in a centrifuge\nfilled with swastikas and Alex Jones’s spittle. Time is finite,\nand now I have more of it.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, I know this conversation is more complicated\nthan that. I’ve lost a large platform to self-promote and make\nprofessional connections, which isn’t something many writers can\nafford to give up (less established writers and marginalized\nwriters most of all &#8212; in a horrid irony, the same writers\ndisproportionately abused on Twitter). I get my news on a slight\ndelay. I seethe at the perception that I ceded any ground to\ntrolls trying to push me out. I will probably never persuade\nRuPaul to be my friend. Also, I loved Twitter. Twitter is funny\nand smart and validating and cathartic. It feels, when you are\nembroiled in it, like the place where everything is happening.\n(Scoff if you like, but the president of the United States makes\nmajor policy announcements there. This is the world now.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I really hope Jack Dorsey reads West&#8217;s piece and takes it to heart. She&#8217;s the last sort of person Twitter should want to leave the platform.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/opinion/quitting-twitter-lindy-west.html\">nytimes.com/2018/02/01/opinion/quitting-twitter-lindy-west</a></strong></em></p>\n"

But for years I logged into Instagram and enjoyed it more\nthan Facebook. I fear a day when I wake up, open my phone and can\nno longer tell the difference between the two.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Regarding ads:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I can now make it through three new posts on Instagram before\nseeing an ad. After that, I get one every six to eight posts.</p>\n\n<p>Instagram’s spokeswoman confirmed ad load is up: “We’ve been able\nto do this by improving the quality and the relevance of the ads.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I really do enjoy using Instagram less these days, and it&#8217;s precisely for the same reasons I never signed up for Facebook. My biggest complaint is the algorithmic timeline &#8212; I truly miss the old timeline where I just saw photos from the people I follow in the order in which they were posted. I&#8217;m sure Instagram has detailed metrics showing that the new timeline increases &#8220;engagement&#8221;, but I&#8217;m equally certain that it&#8217;s led me to check the app less frequently.</p>\n\n<p>But I still don&#8217;t see ads in my Instagram feed. Literally none. This might be because I don&#8217;t have a Facebook account, or might be because my Instagram account is flagged in some sort of hidden way because of my prominence from here at Daring Fireball, or might be a bug.
