Well, here’s what\nmy new life is like: I don’t wake up with a pit in my stomach\nevery day, dreading what horrors accrued in my phone overnight. I\ndon’t get dragged into protracted, bad-faith arguments with\nteenage boys about whether poor people deserve medical care, or\nwhether putting nice guys in the friend zone is a hate crime. I\ndon’t spend hours every week blocking and reporting trolls and\nscreen-grabbing abuse in case it someday escalates into a credible\nthreat. I no longer feel like my brain is trapped in a centrifuge\nfilled with swastikas and Alex Jones’s spittle. Time is finite,\nand now I have more of it.</p>\n\n<p>At the same time, I know this conversation is more complicated\nthan that. I’ve lost a large platform to self-promote and make\nprofessional connections, which isn’t something many writers can\nafford to give up (less established writers and marginalized\nwriters most of all &#8212; in a horrid irony, the same writers\ndisproportionately abused on Twitter). I get my news on a slight\ndelay. I seethe at the perception that I ceded any ground to\ntrolls trying to push me out. I will probably never persuade\nRuPaul to be my friend. Also, I loved Twitter. Twitter is funny\nand smart and validating and cathartic. It feels, when you are\nembroiled in it, like the place where everything is happening.\n(Scoff if you like, but the president of the United States makes\nmajor policy announcements there. This is the world now.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I really hope Jack Dorsey reads West&#8217;s piece and takes it to heart. She&#8217;s the last sort of person Twitter should want to leave the platform.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/01/opinion/quitting-twitter-lindy-west.html\">nytimes.com/2018/02/01/opinion/quitting-twitter-lindy-west</a></strong></em></p>\n"

My biggest complaint is the algorithmic timeline &#8212; I truly miss the old timeline where I just saw photos from the people I follow in the order in which they were posted. I&#8217;m sure Instagram has detailed metrics showing that the new timeline increases &#8220;engagement&#8221;, but I&#8217;m equally certain that it&#8217;s led me to check the app less frequently.</p>\n\n<p>But I still don&#8217;t see ads in my Instagram feed.

Overall I’ve had great\nsuccess with iCloud Photo Library. I’ve got over 18,000 photos and\nalmost 400 videos. And I’ve got a slew of devices &#8212; iPhones,\niPads, and Macs &#8212; all using the same iCloud account. And those\nphotos are available from all those devices. Except, a few weeks\nago, I noticed that on my primary Mac, in Photos, at the bottom of\nthe main “Photos” view, where it tells you exactly how many photos\nand videos you have, it said “Unable to Upload 5 Items”.\nRestarting didn’t fix it. Waiting didn’t fix it. And clicking on\nit didn’t do anything &#8212; I wanted to know which five items\ncouldn’t be uploaded, and why. It seems to me that anybody in this\nsituation would want to know those two things. But damned if\nPhotos would tell me.</p>\n\n<p>Eventually, I found <a href=\"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7174772?start=0&amp;tstart=0\">this support thread</a> which suggested a\nsolution: you can create a Smart Group in Photos using “Unable to\nupload to iCloud Photo Library” as the matching condition. Bingo:\nfive items showed up. (Two of them were videos for which the\noriginal files couldn’t be found; three of them were duplicates of\nphotos that were already in my library.)</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t run into this problem again and am now up to 25,000 photos and just under 900 videos.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2016/02/apples_app_problem\">daringfireball.net/2016/02/apples_app_problem</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Fair enough, except that this\nprocess can take days, depending on the size of your Photos\nlibrary and the speed of your Internet connection. Bad Apple! We\ndon’t see that sort of poor performance with Dropbox or Google\nDrive, and this behavior is both unnecessary and driving people\naway from iCloud Photo Library. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>It’s bad enough that Photos wants to upload every photo to iCloud\nPhoto Library again, but here’s the scenario that triggered this\narticle. When I tried to turn iCloud Photo Library on again, I\nwas told that I didn’t have enough space: my 200 GB iCloud\nstorage plan had only 56 GB free, but my Photos library contained\n113 GB of photos. All that was true, except for the fact that the\nreason my iCloud account was so full was because it already held\nevery one of those photos! Every time I clicked Continue to\nacknowledge that I realized this fact, Photos turned iCloud Photo\nLibrary off again.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is the first of a new column at TidBITS that they&#8217;re calling &#8220;Bad Apple&#8221;, in which they plan to &#8220;dive into a particular aspect of something that Apple got wrong&#8221;. <em>Dive into</em> being the right term for why this is so good.</p>\n\n<p>iCloud Photo Library is pretty great in most regards &#8212; but it&#8217;s not good enough.

There’s little question\nhere that the HomePod is a speaker first, smart second, bucking\nthe trend of the earliest Echo and Google Home devices. Apple’s\nengineers were able to get a lot of rich and full sound out of\nthat little footprint. The speaker is particularly adept as\nisolating vocals and maintaining often muddled aural aspects, like\nbackground singers and audience sounds in live recordings.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The difference between HomePod and Amazon Echo isn&#8217;t that they&#8217;re in different product categories. They&#8217;re in the same category. No one other than a gadget reviewer is going to put both a HomePod and Echo in their kitchen. They&#8217;re going to have one. It is, most certainly, a competition.</p>\n\n<p>The difference is in the priorities behind the devices. All of them are meant to be audio players and useful voice-driven assistants for information, communication, and smart home control. They&#8217;re intended to be adopted fairly widely. But it makes a huge difference what order those priorities are in. HomePod&#8217;s first priority is clearly audio quality. That&#8217;s why it costs $350. Amazon has placed a higher priority on price, which is one reason why Echo doesn&#8217;t sound great.</p>\n\n<p>A lot of the knee-jerk &#8220;<em>Apple has finally lost its goddamn collective mind if they think people are going to spend $350 on a HomePod that costs three times as much as and has far fewer features than an Amazon Echo and they&#8217;re only banging the drum about sound quality because Siri has so many problems</em>&#8221; reaction is entirely from the perspective of people who agree with Amazon&#8217;s priorities regarding Alexa products. Google seems to be in more of a middle ground, offering both an Echo-ish-priced Google Home at $130 and a HomePod-ish-priced $400 Home Max (which, judging from initial reports, clearly does not sound as good as HomePod).</p>\n\n<p>Writing at Medium, I think Lance Ulanoff&#8217;s headline starts the piece off on the wrong foot: &#8220;<a href=\"https://medium.com/@LanceUlanoff/up-close-with-apple-homepod-siris-expensive-new-home-22f1ee0e682\">Up Close With Apple HomePod, Siri’s Expensive New Home</a>&#8221;. If the HomePod&#8217;s primary purpose is to serve as a home for Siri, then yes, it&#8217;s expensive. I imagine that is how Amazon&#8217;s Echo devices came to be: Amazon wanted a way to get Alexa into as many people&#8217;s homes as they could. Alexa came first, the hardware to put it in came second. With HomePod I think it&#8217;s very clear that Apple started with the question of how to create a high-quality speaker for music playback. Using Siri as the primary interface was simply a design decision. But if HomePod&#8217;s primary purpose is to sound better than products like Google Home Max and Sonos One, it is <em>not</em> expensive.</p>\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not interested in higher-end audio quality or are mostly interested in the number of assistant features you can add to such a device, HomePod clearly isn&#8217;t for you. I don&#8217;t think that means it&#8217;s for no one, though. <a href=\"https://www.imore.com/homepod-vs-amazon-echo-vs-google-home-max-vs-sonos-one-speaker-showdown\">Serenity Caldwell&#8217;s first look for iMore</a> is the best I&#8217;ve read so far, because it&#8217;s written from the perspective of judging it for what it is, not what its competitors are.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

This feature will launch in\nBeta with the public availability of iOS 11.3 this spring, with\nthe support of select businesses including Discover, Hilton,\nLowe’s and Wells Fargo. With Business Chat, it&#8217;s easy to have a\nconversation with a service representative, schedule an\nappointment or make purchases using Apple Pay in the Messages\napp. Business Chat doesn’t share the user’s contact information\nwith businesses and gives users the ability to stop chatting at\nany time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>iMessage is one of Apple&#8217;s most underestimated assets. If iMessage were a startup, with exactly the same users, usage (a.k.a. &#8220;engagement&#8221;), and features, it could be worth <a href=\"https://techcrunch.com/2015/02/19/crazy-like-a-facebook-fox/\">tens of billions of dollars</a>. But because it&#8217;s <em>not</em> a startup, Apple is under no pressure to monetize the service in ways that annoy users.</p>\n\n<p>On the battery front:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Additionally, users can now see if the power management feature\nthat dynamically manages maximum performance to prevent unexpected\nshutdowns, first introduced in iOS 10.2.1, is on and can choose to\nturn it off. This feature can be found in Settings &#8594; Battery and\nis available for iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone SE, iPhone 6s,\niPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Being able to disable dynamic performance throttling is new &#8212; if I recall correctly, all Apple had promised last month was that iOS would soon <em>show</em> more information about your battery. [<strong>Update:</strong> The first mention of a switch to control this behavior was <a href=\"http://abcnews.go.com/Business/apple-make-350b-contribution-us-economy-years/story?id=52405662\">in this interview Tim Cook gave to ABC News last week</a>.]</p>\n\n<p>Health:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The new Health Records feature brings together hospitals, clinics\nand the existing Health app to make it easy for consumers to see\ntheir available medical data from multiple providers, whenever\nthey choose. Patients from participating medical institutions will\nhave information from various institutions organized into one view\nand receive regular notifications for their lab results,\nmedications, conditions and more. Health Records data is encrypted\nand protected with a passcode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This could be pretty awesome if it&#8217;s adopted widely by medical professionals. Apple has more information about the program <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/01/apple-announces-effortless-solution-bringing-health-records-to-iPhone/\">in a separate announcement</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Music:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Music will soon be the home for music videos. Users can\nstream all the music videos they want without being\ninterrupted by ads.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Gee, I wonder what video platform that&#8217;s a reference to?</p>\n\n<p>This whole 11.3 announcement is interesting. Some of these features &#8212; like Business Chat &#8212; are things I might have expected they&#8217;d hold for iOS 12. It&#8217;s almost like Apple held a little mini-WWDC over the last two days via Newsroom posts.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

Fortunately, HomePod also\ndelivers where it counts: The sound. When I listened to the\nspeaker next to Google Home Max, the latest Amazon Echo, and Sonos\nOne, the vocals were consistently crisper and clearer on HomePod.\nThe pluck of guitar strings pops, and bass notes have the robust\nthump-thump you want from them.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Interesting that Apple included Google Home Max in the comparisons. Back at WWDC in June, they only compared it against an Echo and a Sonos.</p>\n\n<p>Regarding the limits of how HomePod works with multiple users:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Secondly, although everyone in your apartment will be able to use\nthe speaker, only the person who sets up HomePod on their iCloud\naccount will be able to send texts, set up reminders, and add\nnotes via voice commands. Google Home and Amazon Echo, meanwhile,\ncan recognize different voices and provide personalized content\naccordingly. (If you do set up personal notifications on HomePod,\nthese will only be available when you are on the network, so you\ndon&#8217;t need to worry about your texts being read aloud at home when\nyou are at work.

He broke his iPhone (a bad drop, took it to a third-party repair center, made worse) a few weeks ago and has since then been getting by with an old Android phone that he despises. I knew something happened when his texts turned green, but he&#8217;s the one who brought it up in conversation. He&#8217;s on the fence between buying an iPhone 8 Plus and iPhone X. I’ve been fascinated by his dilemma. It seems to me that if Apple had <em>only</em> released one or the other, he’d have already bought a new one weeks ago. (My advice, because of course he asked and I was glad to answer, however unhelpfully: &#8220;I really love the X but whether you&#8217;d find it worth an extra $200, I can&#8217;t say. You should go talk to the folks at the Apple Store, they&#8217;re good at this, and because they don&#8217;t work on commission, they don&#8217;t just blindly tell everyone to get the most expensive phone.&#8221;) I’ve long been a proponent of the notion that in almost all decisions, there’s the implicit option to choose nothing at all, and the harder a decision is to make, the more likely it is that someone will choose nothing, out of indecision and/or confusion. It&#8217;s the job of designers to make decisions easier, or many times, to make decisions for the user. I&#8217;m not at all saying it was a mistake for Apple to release the iPhones 8 and iPhone X at the same time &#8212; the crux of <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/12/the_iphone_x\">my iPhone X review</a> is that the familiarity of the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus is what freed Apple to change fundamental aspects of the iPhone experience with the iPhone X &#8212; but it really does seem like the choice is difficult for many people.</p>\n\n<p>Anyway, he was here today, and asked me “Hey, what’s up with this thing I saw yesterday that Apple is <em>cancelling</em> the iPhone X?

         "content_html" : "\n<p>Mike Wuerthele, writing for AppleInsider (headline: &#8220;<a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/18/01/19/if-iphone-x-demand-is-less-than-expected-analyst-expects-it-to-be-end-of-life-when-replacements-ship\">If iPhone X Demand Is Less Than Expected, Analyst Expects It to Be &#8216;End of Life&#8217; When Replacements Ship</a>&#8221;):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>In a research note seen by AppleInsider, KGI securities believes\nthat Apple will ship around 18 million of the iPhone X in the\nfirst calendar quarter of 2018. Contrary to other predictions\nbased on the supply chain, KGI says that the iPhone X has not been\nas impactful in China as predicted because of the notch holding\nthe sensors for the device, giving consumers the impression that\nthere is less usable space than on the iPhone 8 Plus.</p>\n\n<p>KGI also expects a trio of iPhone models in the fall of 2018. He\npredicts the iPhone X will be &#8220;end of life&#8221; in the summer of 2018,\ninstead of being retained as a lower-cost option in the following\nyear. If this is the case, it would be the first time that Apple\nhas not retained the previous year&#8217;s model to allow for a wide\nrange of iPhones available at many price points.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This would <em>not</em> be the first time an iPhone flagship model didn&#8217;t stick around for a second year. <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/18/01/19/if-iphone-x-demand-is-less-than-expected-analyst-expects-it-to-be-end-of-life-when-replacements-ship\">In 2013, Apple introduced the iPhone 5S</a> to replace the iPhone 5, and also introduced the iPhone 5C to occupy the second pricing tier. The iPhone 5 was dropped from the product line when the 5S and 5C debuted.<sup id=\"fnr1-2018-01-22\"><a href=\"#fn1-2018-01-22\">1</a></sup></p>\n\n<p>That had nothing to do with the iPhone 5 being unpopular. I think Apple simply wanted a clear distinction between the top-tier and second-tier models. If this rumor is true about this year&#8217;s upcoming new lineup &#8212; <em>if</em> &#8212; I think the exact same logic stands. I think it&#8217;s also the case that it&#8217;s not just about what the iPhone X looks like, but how difficult (and therefore expensive) it is to produce &#8212; the OLED displays in particular. (That almost certainly also factored into the decision to use the plastic-bodied iPhone 5C as the second-tier model, rather than keep the iPhone 5 around for a second year: the iPhone 5 was the first unibody aluminum phone, and <a href=\"https://www.extremetech.com/computing/137707-apples-market-value-drops-60-billion-following-iphone-5-scuff-quality-control-issues\">it was reportedly difficult to produce</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s interesting news that the iPhone X might only be around for one year, to be sure (again, if true), but it&#8217;s not surprising in the least, and it&#8217;s of interest only for us obsessives who follow such things closely. Throw in some poor reading comprehension skills and sensationalist mendacity, though, and you get Anthony Cuthbertson&#8217;s report for the publication that today operates under the once-respected name Newsweek (headline: &#8220;<a href=\"http://www.newsweek.com/apple-about-cancel-iphone-x-poor-sales-mean-device-faces-end-life-786430\">Is Apple About to Cancel the iPhone X? Poor Sales Mean Device Faces &#8216;End of Life&#8217;</a>&#8221;):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When Apple CEO Tim Cook unveiled the iPhone X last September, he\nsaid the $999 device would “set the path of technology for the\nnext decade.” But while its technological credentials may not be\nin question, a poor reception for Apple’s most expensive iPhone\nmay mean it is forced to step off that path within a year of going\non sale.</p>\n\n<p>Rumors stemming from Apple analysts suggest that a reduction in\norders means iPhone X production may cease as early as this\nsummer, which would be the first time Apple has discontinued an\niPhone before unveiling a new model.</p>\n\n<p>A research note by analysts at KGI Securities, <a href=\"http://appleinsider.com/articles/18/01/19/if-iphone-x-demand-is-less-than-expected-analyst-expects-it-to-be-end-of-life-when-replacements-ship\">seen by Apple news\nsite AppleInsider</a>, estimated iPhone X shipments in the first\nquarter of 2018 were at around 18 million devices &#8212; a significant\nreduction on previous flagship iPhones.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Cuthbertson&#8217;s only source is AppleInsider&#8217;s summary of Ming-Chi Kuo&#8217;s report &#8212; and he&#8217;s drawing conclusions that simply weren&#8217;t in the original. Cuthbertson is laying out a scenario where Apple stops selling the iPhone X this summer, months before new models are announced in September. That would indeed be a sensational &#8212; downright humiliating &#8212; setback for Apple. But there&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s going to happen, and it&#8217;s also not what AppleInsider says Kuo expects. What Kuo said is that Apple might stop producing new iPhone X units once they&#8217;ve made enough to keep shelves stocked until September. Kuo does suggest that this might be because sales of the iPhone X are disappointing (particularly in China), but Kuo&#8217;s record is only good regarding <em>what</em> is going on in Apple&#8217;s Asian supply chain, not <em>why</em>. If Kuo is correct that the iPhone X will be dropped from next year&#8217;s iPhone lineup, I don&#8217;t think the reason has anything to do with how well it sold.</p>\n\n<p>Also, even if it&#8217;s true that Apple will &#8220;only&#8221; sell 18 million iPhone X units in the first calendar quarter of 2018, you have to put that in context with the fact that the iPhone X debuted alongside the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which had the features, design, and prices of what in any previous year would have been <em>the</em> top-tier new iPhones.</p>\n\n<p>Everything about Cuthbertson&#8217;s report &#8212; starting with that fucking headline,<sup id=\"fnr2-2018-01-22\"><a href=\"#fn2-2018-01-22\">2</a></sup> which arguably is all that matters for a publication like today&#8217;s Newsweek, which is, I would bet, hopelessly dependent upon social media traffic and utterly disdainful of the notion of building up a wellspring of trust with a devoted readership &#8212; seems written to paint a picture of the iPhone X being a sales failure, facts be damned, and nothing about it &#8212; not a single sentence &#8212; seems geared toward giving the reader an accurate, genuine understanding of what&#8217;s actually going on with sales of the current iPhone lineup.</p>\n\n<p>And don&#8217;t even get me started about the dreck that is <a href=\"https://duckduckgo.com/?q=macalope+gordon+kelly\">well-known-dipstick</a> Forbes &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theinternetpatrol.com/huffington-post-shuts-down-100000-strong-contributor-network-without-warning/\">contributor</a>&#8221; Gordon Kelly&#8217;s jacktastically headlined piece, &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/gordonkelly/2018/01/21/apple-iphone-x-buy-sales-specs-new-iphone-release-date/#2f599c5e10cb\">Apple Leak Reveals Sudden iPhone X Cancellation</a>&#8221;. This piece isn&#8217;t even up to Forbes&#8217;s usual standard of at least <a href=\"http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2018/01/stormy-daniels-once-claimed-she-spanked-donald-trump-with-a-forbes-magazine/\">being worth rolling up and using as a sex toy</a> on short-fingered vulgarians.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n\n<li id=\"fn1-2018-01-22\">\n<p>The original iPhone should count, too. When the iPhone 3G debuted, Apple stopped selling the original iPhone. In fact, the more I think about it, the more it feels like it&#8217;s fair to say that the norm is for radically new iPhone form factors <em>not</em> to remain in the lineup at a lower price the next year. To my mind, the new iPhones that qualify as &#8220;radically new form factors&#8221; are: the original iPhone in 2007 (of course), the iPhone 4 in 2010 (first retina display, glass back, external antenna), the iPhone 5 in 2012 (aluminum unibody), and the iPhone X (OLED display, Face ID sensor array). I don&#8217;t think the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus qualify, because I&#8217;m talking about things that make a new iPhone design difficult and/or unusually expensive to manufacture and assemble &#8212; they looked different just because they were bigger, but I don&#8217;t think there was anything about them that made them more difficult to assemble than the iPhone 5/5S. Of those radically new iPhones, only one, the iPhone 4, hung around in the product lineup at a lower price after its successor debuted. That&#8217;s particularly humorous, given that the iPhone 4 was the iPhone with the most-publicized design &#8220;flaw&#8221; &#8212; the antenna that was subject to attenuation issues if, you know, you held it wrong. <em>And</em> the iPhone 4 suffered from what was inarguably the worst manufacturing problem in the entire history of the product: the white models <a href=\"https://www.macworld.com/article/1159502/white_iphone4_shipping.html\">shipped almost an entire year late</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2018-01-22\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;︎</a></p>\n</li>\n\n<li id=\"fn2-2018-01-22\">\n<p>I put a lot of thought into getting my own headlines <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2008/03/fucking_headline\">just right</a>.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr2-2018-01-22\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 2 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

If\nthe universe feels a little hollow this week, now you know why.</p>\n\n<p>Jason Hoffman, founder of Joyent and a close friend, called out of\nthe blue. He has just moved back from Stockholm, back to the Bay\nArea after a stint at Ericsson. “Dean is no more,” Jason said. He\nwas fighting to hold back his tears, his voice shaking. I think I\nheard Jason say that Dean took his own life, giving up on the\nstruggle.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Dean was a magnificent bastard. His death is a real gut punch. I heard about it two days ago, and still can&#8217;t believe it. Om&#8217;s obituary is simply splendid, capturing the man I knew.</p>\n\n<p>Textism was such an achingly-good thing &#8212; an utterly personal website of exquisite writing and beautiful design. Unlike most who came from the print world &#8212; and Dean was a mightily talented print designer &#8212; Dean loved and truly <em>got</em> the web. He knew it wasn&#8217;t an ersatz throwaway stand-in for people too cheap to pay for the print edition of a magazine or newspaper. He knew the web was a wonderful new medium of its own, a glorious playground ripe for anything. Textism was well-paced.</p>\n\n<p>Dean strove for perfection and often achieved it.</p>\n\n<p>Textism started in 2001, a little over a year before I started Daring Fireball. To say that Textism was an influence on Daring Fireball is an understatement for the ages. Fairer to say Textism was <em>the</em> influence on Daring Fireball. I don&#8217;t know what DF would&#8217;ve wound up looking and reading like if not for Dean Allen, but it wouldn&#8217;t look or read like it did and does. For godsake <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20021210080822/http://textism.com:80/about/\">just read his old About page</a>. It&#8217;s so good, and so <em>Dean</em>.</p>\n\n<p>On the indie web of the early 2000s, Dean Allen was <em>the man</em>. There&#8217;s just no other way to put it. He did it better than anyone, week after week, post after post. And then he just walked away from it. For a while, the long-dormant home page of Textism.com was replaced by a single word: &#8220;<a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20130822210522/http://textism.com/\">Retooling</a>.&#8221; The thought that Textism might someday spring back to life made me downright giddy.</p>\n\n<p>The closest I ever came to telling Dean what an influence Textism was on Daring Fireball was the following, in an email in 2002, after I wrote to him to thank him for a post on Textism &#8212; <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20021226034931/http://textism.com:80/article/648/\">announcing the release of Textile</a> &#8212; that described yours truly as &#8220;witheringly talented&#8221;:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Textism has been an inordinate influence on me; there is nothing\nelse quite like it, but I wish there were.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Daring Fireball was only months old when I wrote that. We were frequent email correspondents in those days. He was, as you would expect considering his sublime entry titles at Textism, a master of the clever Subject: line. I helped him with the quote-educating algorithms in Textile. He helped me form the basis of Markdown. (I was badgering Dean with a series of &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you change the syntax of Textile to be more like <em>this</em> and <em>this</em>?&#8221; requests. Dean&#8217;s response was, more or less, &#8220;These are great ideas, but why don&#8217;t you just put them in your own thing?&#8221;)</p>\n\n<p>A year later, Dean wrote me this:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Date: Fri, 14 Nov 2003 19:38:16 +0100 <br />\nFrom: Dean Allen <br />\nSubject: Empty Coffee Pot</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>I really really liked the OSX screen reading essay.</p></li>\n<li><p>Good job on the Waffle interview: you’re really establishing a\nVoice. Something most writers can only dream of.</p></li>\n<li><p>I plan to start corresponding with people again once I get over\nthe guilt of not having corresponded with people while I went\nthrough the Samsa-like transformation from someone who got away\nwith pretending the rest of the internet didn’t exist into\nsomeone who did not.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>Yr lad,</p>\n\n<p>- dca</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>(The &#8220;OSX screen reading essay&#8221; was <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2003/11/panther_text_rendering\">this 2,900-word exegesis on the improvements to text rendering in Mac OS X 10.3</a>. The &#8220;Waffle interview&#8221; was <a href=\"https://web.archive.org/web/20040602234722/http://iron.wootest.net/john_gruber.php\">this</a>.)</p>\n\n<p>Dean Allen telling me I was &#8220;establishing a Voice&#8221; is the only compliment about my work that I&#8217;ve ever remembered. That&#8217;s when I knew that maybe I was actually hitting the notes I was trying to hit.</p>\n\n<p>We lost contact in the years of his self-imposed internet exile. Our last email exchange was over seven years ago. Every few months, though, it would occur to me that I dearly missed Textism, and I&#8217;d think to write Dean and tell him so &#8212; and to tell him that his offhand compliment in 2003 was still something I thought about all the time. Thinking maybe he&#8217;d be pleased to hear that, and perhaps he <em>needed</em> to hear it. I never did.</p>\n\n<p>I wish I had.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

If you try to take a screenshot on Confide,\nyou will now simply capture a blank screen¹. ScreenShield also\nprotects against other forms of screen capture, including iOS 11\nscreen recording, AirPlay screen mirroring, QuickTime screen\nrecording as well as taking screenshots from the app switcher or\nby using Xcode.</p>\n\n<p>We initially developed ScreenShield for Confide, but quickly\nrealized that it could be used in a large number of apps &#8212; far\nmore than we could build ourselves. That’s why we created\n<a href=\"https://screenshieldkit.com/\">ScreenShieldKit</a> &#8212; to offer the ScreenShield technology to\n3rd-party developers for use in a variety of different apps and\ncategories.</p>\n\n<p>While there’s a lot of technology under the hood that makes\nScreenShield possible, the great news is that there are no strange\ngimmicks for users (e.g., it doesn’t require them to hold their\nfinger on the screen) &#8212; it just works as expected. And\nScreenShieldKit is simple for developers to integrate into their\niOS apps, providing easy to use replacements for UITextView and\nUIImageView.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an interesting puzzle trying to figure out how they&#8217;re doing this. Detecting that a screenshot <em>has</em> been taken is easy &#8212; <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiscreencaptureddidchangenotification\">iOS has an API</a> that apps can use to get notified when the screen is recorded in any way. But ScreenShield is detecting it <em>before</em> the screenshot gets taken, so they can blank out the content in their text and image views.</p>\n\n<p>I wasn&#8217;t familiar with Confide, so I downloaded it and kicked the tires, and the screenshot prevention works as advertised. Confide <em>also</em> sends a notification to whomever you&#8217;re messaging with to warn them that you <em>tried</em> to take a screenshot, <em>a la</em> Snapchat, and they immediately delete the message you tried to capture (I presume so that you can&#8217;t try to capture it another way, like, say, by taking a photo of the screen &#8212; see below).</p>\n\n<p>My best guess as to how they&#8217;re doing this is that they&#8217;re using AVPlayer and somehow using <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/iOSProgramming/comments/6h1nkc/how_are_apps_like_netflix_hbo_go_blocking_screen/\">FairPlay Streaming</a> to block screenshots and recording. (Where by &#8220;my&#8221; best guess I mean the best guess of <a href=\"http://bitsplitting.org/\">a smart friend</a> who poked around the Confide app bundle.) Have you ever noticed how you can&#8217;t take screenshots of streaming video content in apps like Netflix and HBO Go/Now? That&#8217;s a feature in iOS (and MacOS &#8212; try taking a screenshot of Netflix video playing in Safari) for skittish video providers who don&#8217;t want us to capture even a still frame of their precious content. I <em>think</em> ScreenShieldKit is somehow using this to prevent screenshots or video captures of text or images.</p>\n\n<p>If anyone out there has a better or more informed guess, please let me know.</p>\n\n<p>If I&#8217;m reading their application correctly, Confide has also filed for a patent <a href=\"http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-bool.html&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;co1=AND&amp;d=PTXT&amp;s1=9648001&amp;OS=9648001&amp;RS=9648001\">for a way to identify when you&#8217;re using another device to take a photo of your screen</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n    "
